** Shape of the curve expalins a lot for the data, B does look like a persistent time series(natural),
whereas A looks synthetic and compeletly unnatural for signal1**

Hurst exponent A:0.53303
Hurst exponent B:0.52087
Hurst exponent C:0.43018 (when Scale limit was (32, 430))


I changed the scale array,for some graphs(A's component went below 0.49)
The data as you can see, mean , median and mode will do little to nothing to explain the data and
this increases the importance of fractal analysis, I took only first 700 value in each case because
it was taking really long to make the graphs, but numbers dont lie, I have checked the DFA algorithm
and the results produced are correct,(Found this online Hurst value more than one means unsuccesful detrending)
so the Hurst exponent more than 0.5 suggests persistent behaviour, less than 0.5 suggests synthetic data(unnatural),
or anti persistent. If a natural looking data(coast line, heartbeat, numpy random walk) is taken then the Hurst exponent
will rise closer to one.(Criticality), time series which encapsulates
nature have higher hurst component in fractal analysis.

** Complexity of the classes **
As we can see Labels A and B, signal 1, has successful detrending, the hurst values in the correct range, changing the
scale of the DFA had pronounced effect on DFA component, I changed the Scale array multiple times, Signal 1 in label A
and B had very little effect, I conclude that the DFA was successful and the classes A and B are less complex when
compared to C.
class C showed unsuccesful detrending in DFA.
The Hurst value is out of range for signal 2 for all classes.


** Conclusion ** : Classes A and B are not as complex as Class C. I conclude that signal 2 would be unfit for DFA.
